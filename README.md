# Zombie-C3
A zombie project for revive a half-burned esp32 C3 supermini
This device can scan 2.4 gHz WI-FI networks and show these.
It can show the time for working on, how much RAM is free.
Also show details a WI-FI network which's signal is most powerful on your location.
But not connect any network because hasn't any connection code inside.
(Because my C3's antenna's tx part is burned. Not working for me.)
You can change the page when the press button.
If you can connect any WI-FI, you have to customize the code.
